  dialogue:
  - The door is locked, and I look through the crack in the door.
  - In the dim light, I glimpse a shadowy figure, its eyes gleaming with an unnatural
    glow, staring at me deeply.
  - My heart pound in my chest as dread washes over me.
  - Finally, I take a breath and pretend not seeing anything, but the image of those
    eerie eyes haunt my thoughts long after.
