  dialogue:
  - It's a cold, lifeless fireplace, its once warm glow but now only last emptiness.
  - Residue in the fireplace seems to have burned out for a long time; no spark,

  - But wait, what's this?
  - A fragile fragment of note paper stuck in the corner.
  responses:
  - responseText: Pick up the fragment.
